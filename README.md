Introduction to Data Science Course Project

Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
This project will be an analysis on my own Youtube usage.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of my YouTube usage patterns. By examining my viewing habits via my watch history considering which days i watch more videos, and what time of the day i watch more videos, also how often do i engage with comments,and  which days and times i add videos to my Watch Later playlist. I aim to uncover meaningful insights about my online behavior and interests.


## Data Source

I have only one source of data:

Data is directly exported from Google Takeout, selecting YouTube ve YouTube Music data request.
